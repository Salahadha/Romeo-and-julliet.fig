<h1 class="hfig">What Are The Figurative Language Used in Romeo & Juliet</h1>


<p>

    <div class="types">
     <h2>1. Metaphor</h2> <br><br>
    
    Directly compares two unrelated things without "like" or "as." <br>
    
    Example: "Juliet is the sun" (Act 2, Scene 2). Romeo compares Juliet to the sun, implying she is his light and life. <br><br><br>


    <h2>2. Simile</h2> <br><br>
    
    Compares two things using "like" or "as." <br>
    
    Example: "Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books" (Act 2, Scene 2). Love’s eagerness is likened to children escaping school. <br><br><br>


    <h2>3. Personification </h2><br><br>
    
    Gives human traits to non-human <br>
    
    Example: "Death lies on her like an untimely frost" (Act 4, Scene 5). Death is portrayed as a physical force. <br><br><br>

  <h2>  4. Hyperbole</h2> <br><br>
    
    Exaggeration for emphasis. <br>
    
    Example: "My bounty is as boundless as the sea, my love as deep" (Act 2, Scene 2). Juliet exaggerates to express infinite love. <br><br><br>

 <h2>   5. Oxymoron</h2> <br><br>
    
    Pairs contradictory terms. <br>
    
    Example: "loving hate," "heavy lightness" (Act 1, Scene 1). Captures Romeo’s emotional turmoil. <br><br><br>
